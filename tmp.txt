 - Students develop Core Competencies at home as well as at school, making parent/guardian support for students’ growing awareness, understanding, and development of the Core Competencies crucial

 - Formal school tasks and activities often look different from the more informal tasks students are involved in at home. While both contexts are valuable, parents/guardians can expect that a student’s use of the Core Competencies may look very different in these two contexts
 - The illustrations offer examples from a variety of contexts and can provide parents/guardians with a new lens through which to view their students’ development as educated citizens
