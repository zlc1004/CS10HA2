      <p>
        The Core Competencies are sets of intellectual, personal, and social and
        emotional proficiencies that all students need in order to engage in
        deep, lifelong learning. Along with literacy and numeracy foundations,
        they are central to British Columbia’s K-12 curriculum and assessment
        system and directly support students in their growth as educated
        citizens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students develop Core Competencies when they are engaged in the “doing”
        – the Curricular Competencies – within a learning area. As such, they
        are an integral part of the curriculum. While they manifest themselves
        uniquely in each area of learning, the Core Competencies are often
        interconnected and are foundational to all learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before students enter school, development of Core Competencies begins at
        home and then continues throughout their life. Students encounter
        opportunities to develop their competence in formal and informal
        settings. They move from demonstrating competence in relatively simple
        and highly supported situations, to demonstrating independence in more
        complex and varied contexts. Competency development does not end with
        school graduation but continues in personal, social, educational, and
        workplace contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students, teachers, and parents/guardians share responsibility for the
        ongoing development of Core Competencies. Each group has its own
        considerations.
